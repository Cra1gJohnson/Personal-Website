## React and Front-end
Welcome! In this first post, I will be writing about React and other front-end tools that I have found useful or hazardous. 

First, I will talk about React. This website is my second project built with React, but my first time acting as the "polishing" developer, my introduction was during a hackathon. I have to comment on the ease of using it in conjunction with vite. Setup is as simple as a snap. I've developed site in using HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, and Express.js before, but unlike these other libraries and frameworks I really felt pushed to develop detailed components using react. The re-usability really shines. 

To get this specific site up I used NGINX, which was a breeze. A tweak of the config and everything ran smoothly, of course later on Certbot took over and worked its magic. I'll report back when I am running multiple sites and subdomains as I imagine my .conf file will grow. I purchased my domain from Cloudflare, I considered using a subdomain from duckduckgo, but ended up shelling out the bucks. I have always found that an initial investment encourages hard work. Cloudflare’s UI wasn't the most intuitive, but it was also my first time using it. The most challenging aspect was writing and scheduling a bash script to run DDNS from my Pi. Some of this was my lack of confidence with bash, some my ignorance with cron. It took a little work but ended up being quite elegant.

Lastly is VScode, which I used in conjunction with git to develop the site. I feel that it the superior editor for web development, of course. "npm run dev" was a god send, especially for the ascetics 

Huge thanks and credit to Christian Walker who collaborated and helped to build the site.
