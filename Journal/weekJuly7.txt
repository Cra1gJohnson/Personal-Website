    - I have been slacking a lot recently. Maybe I just needed a break but I am feeling very motivated.
    - I like the idea of looking at other websites but need to distinguish our own unique design instead of just copying which can be difficult.
    - I worked on making a unique experience going for the idea of having a "browser window within a broswer" and all of the components being displayed the same in terms of positioning.
    - In terms of visual I want to try some things.
    Font: Moon Rounded Typeface

    I think a big part is font.
    - Began to try to create a very light experience tab.

    Same day but later.
    - Got the new navbar to a functioning state.
    - Format is decent but I think color scheme needs an update.
        - To go more in depth I think we should use one color and shades of that color.
        - Maybe 2 but a generally darker color that is the background and border of things and then a more vibrant color that servers as a navigator.
    - Font is nice but always caps. Might need to find a similar font that allows for lowercase.

    - messed about with the tabs bar. to make make it change content. All the tabs bar pages are in components. even though they have same names as our current pages. I think we should
        restructure the whole website to stay on the say page and only change the displayed component.

    - Added a div bar to the tabsbar. However, the logic isn't there to figure out what the current page is to auto put it there.
    - Need to figure out logic that makes it that the bar is placed under the text of whatever page the user is on and that the size of the bar is set properly.

    - Updated general color pallete of website. Colors mesh much better together.
    - Made navbar/tabbar buttons have the same background as that color pallete as to not stand out
    - Made the App.jsx be the main page for handling all tbe main page functions instead of ExperiencePage.jsx
    - Made the navbar links work as they did in ExperiencePage.jsx
    - Updated the links to ease into a color on hover.
    - Added an "active tab bar" that moves within the tabbar depending on what tab the user picks. Animation looks smooth.
