    - Did some changes yesterday that I forgot to commit.
    - Moving some css styling to index.css.
    - Most of it was making text and things change when zoom and not having zoom break anything
    - Made zoom for main container (tab content) work by adding min width of 650px.
    - For text using clamp() function can be good. Basically just a min value, preferred value, and max value. Could also be good for some divs or text holding things.
    - Haven't started @media stuff. Will probably have everything work with zoom, merge branch, and then start a new branch to make sidebar go above the main container.
    - Added "SocialBar" to the bottom of "SideBar". Made sure that the spacing on it works as well and that the animations are clean.

    - Merged in the zoom changes to main
    - Created a basic timeline that is functional with dummy data and dates.
    - Added updated version of Moon rounded font. Can use the lowercase version for body text. However, all prexisting things should be kept using old font since I think titles and other things look good as is.
    - Added some real data to Experience tab.
